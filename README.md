# e3nn little

Small version of [e3nn](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn/)

# Plan
## To import

- [x] spherical harmonics
- [x] Rs operations
- [x] Wigner representations (up to L=11)
- [x] 3J symbols (up to L=11)
- [x] Gate (parity)
- [x] radial networks
- [x] Tensor Product (Weighted)
- [x] message_passing (in examples)
- [ ] s2grid
- [ ] reduce_tensor
- [ ] s2/so3 activation
- [ ] batchnorm
- [ ] dropout
- [ ] groupnorm
- [ ] image convolution (requires kernel?!)
- [ ] tests!
- [ ] cuda kernels!
- [ ] tensor classes

## To leave

- kernels?
- sparse tensor product
- data_helpers (contribute to `pytorch_geometric` instead)
- norm activation
